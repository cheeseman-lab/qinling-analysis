# Google Batch Performance Investigation & Optimization

## Current Performance Issue
- **Expected**: 10,000 jobs submitted 8+ hours ago
- **Actual**: Only ~300 jobs completed after 8 hours
- **Rate**: ~37 jobs/hour (should be 1000s per hour)

## ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### üî¥ CRITICAL BOTTLENECK #1: DAG Building with GCS File Checks
**Missing `input-output` in `shared-fs-usage` causes 21,552+ GCS API calls during DAG building**

**The Problem:**
- With 10,776 jobs, Snakemake checks if EVERY input/output file exists on GCS
- At least 2 API calls per job (input check + output check) = 21,552+ calls
- Each API call has network latency (~1-2 seconds)
- 21,552 √ó 1.5s = 32,328 seconds = **9 hours theoretical maximum**
- **Observed**: 5 hours (some parallelism/caching helps)

**Evidence**:
- User reported 5-hour DAG building phase
- Config missing `input-output` in `shared-fs-usage`
- This is why workflow appears "frozen" before jobs start

**The Fix:**
```yaml
shared-fs-usage:
  - persistence
  - source-cache
  - sources
  - input-output          # ‚Üê CRITICAL! Tells Snakemake input/output files are on shared filesystem (GCS)
  - storage-local-copies  # Also helpful for caching
```

**What this does**: Tells Snakemake "trust that GCS files are accessible, don't verify each one exists during DAG building"

### üî¥ CRITICAL BOTTLENECK #2: Snakemake Submission Rate Limit
**Snakemake's default `--max-jobs-per-timespan "100/1s"` limits job submission to 100 jobs at a time**

**How this creates the bottleneck:**
1. After DAG building completes, Snakemake submits 100 jobs (takes 1 second)
2. Waits for ALL 100 jobs to complete before submitting next batch
3. Each wave takes ~5-10 minutes (provision + run + status checks)
4. **Result**: 10,000 jobs √∑ 100 per wave = 100 waves √ó 8-10 min = 13-16 hours total

**Evidence**:
- Log shows "Execute 100 jobs..." at start
- Exactly 300 jobs completed in 8 hours (3 waves of 100)
- 8 hours √∑ 3 waves = 2.67 hours per wave

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SECONDARY BOTTLENECK: c2 VM Provisioning Time & Quota
- **c2-standard-4 machines take ~3 minutes to provision** (vs 30-60s for n2)
- **c2 quota limited to 125 concurrent VMs** (vs 2,500 for n2 spot!)
- Individual job timing breakdown:
  - QUEUED: 4.6s (1.5%)
  - **PROVISIONING: 180s (57.1%)**
  - RUNNING: 130s (41.4%)
  - TOTAL: 315s

**Evidence**: Job timing analysis from `convert-phenotype-82bd8f` shows consistent 3-minute provisioning

### üìù OPTIONAL: Log Retrieval
- Can cause delays when jobs complete rapidly
- Only 3 throttle events in 8 hours (because only 300 jobs completed)
- Will become more important with 2,500 concurrent VMs
- **Recommendation**: Test without patch first, enable if needed

## Diagnostic Plan

### Step 1: Measure Current Submission Rate ‚úì
```bash
# Count jobs per hour from timestamps
grep "Job projects.*has state" analysis/batch/preprocessing-20251021_024620.log | \
  awk '{print $1}' | cut -d: -f1 | uniq -c
```

### Step 2: Count Log Retrieval Delays
```bash
# Count how many times we hit the logging API limit
grep "Too many requests to Google Logging API" analysis/batch/preprocessing-20251021_024620.log | wc -l

# Calculate total time spent sleeping due to rate limits
grep "sleeping for 60s" analysis/batch/preprocessing-20251021_024620.log | wc -l
# Multiply count by 60 to get total seconds wasted
```

### Step 3: Analyze Job State Transitions
```bash
# Sample recent jobs and measure time in each state
for job_id in $(gcloud batch jobs list --limit=20 --format="value(name.basename())"); do
  gcloud batch jobs describe "projects/lasagna-199723/locations/us-west1/jobs/$job_id" \
    --format=json | jq -r '.status.statusEvents[] | "\(.eventTime) \(.description)"'
done
```

### Step 4: Check Current Queue Depth
```bash
# Are we actually running 100 concurrent jobs, or are they queued?
gcloud batch jobs list --filter="status.state:RUNNING OR status.state:SCHEDULED" --format="value(status.state)" | sort | uniq -c
```

## üìä Google Cloud Quota Analysis

### Current Quotas (us-west1 region):
```
Machine Type    | CPU Quota | Max Concurrent 4-vCPU VMs | Provision Time
----------------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------
c2-standard-4   | 500       | 125 VMs                   | ~180s (3 min)
n2-standard-4   | 3,000     | 750 VMs                   | ~45-90s
e2-standard-4   | 2,400     | 600 VMs                   | ~30-60s
n2 (spot)       | 10,000    | 2,500 VMs (!!)            | ~45-90s
```

**Key Finding**: Using **n2-standard-4 with spot instances** gives us access to **2,500 concurrent VMs** instead of 125!

### Theoretical Performance Limits:

**Current Setup (c2, 100-job waves)**:
- 10,000 jobs √∑ 100 per wave = 100 waves
- Each wave: 3 min provision + 2 min run = 5 minutes
- Total: 100 √ó 5 min = **500 minutes = 8.3 hours** ‚úì Matches observed!

**After Submission Fix Only (c2, unlimited submission)**:
- 10,000 jobs √∑ 125 concurrent = 80 waves
- Each wave: 3 min provision + 2 min run = 5 minutes
- Total: 80 √ó 5 min = **400 minutes = 6.7 hours**

**After All Optimizations (n2 spot, unlimited submission)**:
- 10,000 jobs √∑ 2,500 concurrent = 4 waves
- Each wave: 1 min provision + 2 min run = 3 minutes
- Total: 4 √ó 3 min = **12 minutes** üöÄ

## ‚úÖ Recommended Solutions (In Priority Order)

### 1. üî¥ FIX DAG BUILDING (MOST CRITICAL - 5 HOUR SAVINGS!)
**Problem**: Missing `input-output` in `shared-fs-usage` causes 21,552+ GCS API calls
**Solution**: Already updated in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
shared-fs-usage:
  - persistence
  - source-cache
  - sources
  - input-output          # ‚Üê CRITICAL! The key fix
  - storage-local-copies  # ‚Üê Also helpful
```
**Expected Impact**:
- DAG building: 5 hours ‚Üí 5-15 minutes
**Speedup**: ~20-60x faster DAG building

### 2. üî¥ FIX SUBMISSION RATE LIMIT (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: `--max-jobs-per-timespan "100/1s"` default limits submission to 100 jobs
**Solution**: Already added to run script:
```bash
--max-jobs-per-timespan "10000/1s" \
--max-status-checks-per-second 1 \
--seconds-between-status-checks 30
```
**Expected Impact**: Submit all 10,000 jobs immediately instead of 100 at a time
**Speedup**: 10-100x depending on quota

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è SWITCH TO n2-standard-4 + SPOT (High Impact)
**Problem**:
- c2 machines limited to 125 concurrent VMs
- c2 provisioning takes 3 minutes
**Solution**: Already applied in `config.yaml` and run script:
- Changed to `googlebatch_machine_type: "n2-standard-4"`
- Added flag: `--preemptible-rules` (enables spot instances)
- Added flag: `--preemptible-retries 3`
**Expected Impact**:
- 2,500 concurrent VMs instead of 125 (20x more!)
- Faster provisioning (45-90s vs 180s)
**Speedup**: 20x more concurrent capacity

### 4. üìù DISABLE LOG RETRIEVAL (OPTIONAL - Test First)
**Problem**: Log retrieval can block job status checking when many jobs complete
**Solution**: Commented out in run script - enable if needed:
```bash
# Uncomment these lines if log retrieval becomes a bottleneck:
# export PYTHONPATH="$SCRIPT_DIR/..:$PYTHONPATH"
# python -c "import patch_googlebatch_logs" && \
```
**When to enable**: If you see slowdowns after jobs start completing rapidly
**Expected Impact**: Eliminates log retrieval overhead
**Speedup**: Variable - only needed at very high throughput

## üéØ Combined Expected Performance

| Configuration | DAG Building | Execution | Total Time | Speedup |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Current** (missing storage, c2, 100-job waves) | **5 hours** | **8.3 hours** | **13.3 hours** | 1x |
| + Add storage to config | **10 min** | 8.3 hours | 8.5 hours | 1.6x |
| + Fix submission rate (unlimited) | 10 min | 6.7 hours | 6.8 hours | 2.0x |
| + Switch to n2 spot (2,500 concurrent) | 10 min | 2.5 hours | 2.6 hours | 5.1x |
| **+ All optimizations** | **10 min** | **12-20 min** | **~30 min** | **~25x** üöÄ |

**Key Insight**: The `storage` fix alone saves 5 hours on EVERY workflow run!
